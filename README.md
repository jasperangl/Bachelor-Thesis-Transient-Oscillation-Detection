# üìä Evaluating and Analyzing LSTM Models for Transient Oscillation Detection

This repository accompanies a bachelor thesis project that explores how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models can be used to detect transient neural oscillations‚Äîbursts of activity in EEG-like time-series data. The work emphasizes model performance across features, noise conditions, and architecture variants, and introduces interpretability analyses on LSTM internals.

## üß† Overview

This thesis evaluated LSTM-based models for detecting transient neural oscillations across frequency bands and noise levels, with BiLSTMs achieving the most robust performance, though detection in the theta band remained challenging under low SNR. A comparison of input representations showed that computed features benefited simpler models, while deeper recurrent networks performed well on raw input alone. Under matched model complexity, LSTM variants consistently outperformed MLPs and threshold-based baselines. Interpretability analyses revealed that gate and state dynamics adapted to encode burst structure, suggesting the emergence of functionally specialized units within LSTM layers.

## üßæ Key Findings

From the thesis and `Colloquium New.pptx` presentation:

- **Feature importance:** Hilbert & wavelet features boost simpler models; deep LSTMs learn from raw signals.
- **Architecture matters:** BiLSTMs outperform LSTM and MLP variants in noisy or feature-poor setups.
- **Cell specialization:** Specific cells adapt to signal type, frequency, or noise level.
- **Gating behavior:** Cell states and gates reflect structured internal filtering aligned with signal semantics.
